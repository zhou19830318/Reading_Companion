// BLE HID Host for the page-turner feature (ONEPAGE_C61 only).
//
// Acts as a BLE Central + HID host: scans for a BLE HID page-turner, connects,
// discovers the HID service (0x1812) and its Report characteristics (0x2A4D),
// subscribes to input-report notifications. Instead of a fixed keycode table it
// uses a LEARNING model: the pairing UI arms a learn for "page forward" / "page
// back"; the next key the user presses is captured as a full report pattern
// (characteristic handle + payload bytes). At runtime incoming reports are
// matched byte-for-byte against the two learned patterns and the matching page
// action is posted to a queue drained by the main loop (HalGPIO::update()).
//
// Threading: NimBLE callbacks run on the BLE host task. The only cross-task
// paths are (a) the action queue (BLE task xQueueSend -> main loop
// xQueueReceive) and (b) volatile learn flags. No renderer/activity calls from
// the BLE task.
//
// Single-core coexistence: start()/stop() toggle HalPowerManager::setBleActive
// so the CPU stays at full speed while connected (10 MHz low-power mode breaks
// the BLE controller's radio timing -> interrupt WDT reboot).
